# Implementation Plan - Recon Launch Campaign

## 1. 🔍 Analysis & Context
*   **Objective:** Execute a high-impact launch campaign for "Recon" (The Market Intelligence CLI) on LinkedIn, Reddit, and Facebook, leveraging the "Cynical Engineer" persona to drive downloads and establish authority.
*   **Affected Files:**
    *   `Business/Vega/Marketing/RECON_LAUNCH_CAMPAIGN.md` (New Strategy Doc)
    *   `Business/Vega/Marketing/social_posts/linkedin_recon_launch.md` (New)
    *   `Business/Vega/Marketing/social_posts/reddit_recon_launch.md` (New)
*   **Key Dependencies:**
    *   **Assets:** Screenshots of "Sandpaper Underwear" (Fail) vs "Leftover Labs" (Success) scans.
    *   **Link:** `https://github.com/OhYesssItsTesss/Recon`
*   **Risks/Unknowns:**
    *   **Self-Promotion Rules:** Reddit communities (`r/python`, `r/sideproject`) are strict. Posts must be "Value First," not just link drops.

## 2. 📋 Checklist
- [ ] **Step 1: Strategy Document:** Define the hook, the story, and the "Bait."
- [ ] **Step 2: LinkedIn Posts:** Draft 3 variants (The Story, The Flex, The Roast).
- [ ] **Step 3: Reddit Posts:** Draft "Show and Tell" style posts for technical subreddits.
- [ ] **Step 4: Facebook Strategy:** Draft a "Helpful Expert" post for entrepreneur groups.

## 3. 📝 Step-by-Step Implementation Details

### Step 1: Strategy Document
*   **Goal:** Centralize the messaging.
*   **Action:** Create `Business/Vega/Marketing/RECON_LAUNCH_CAMPAIGN.md`.
*   **Core Message:** "Stop building ghosts. Validate first."
*   **The Hook:** "I built this because I failed." (Vulnerability = Trust).

### Step 2: LinkedIn Series
*   **Goal:** Professional Authority.
*   **Drafts:**
    1.  **"The Wake Up Call":** How I wasted months on ideas nobody wanted -> The Solution.
    2.  **"The Technical Deep Dive":** How I built a Reddit Scraper without an API Key (Technical credibility).
    3.  **"The Horror Story":** Analyzing a terrible idea (Sandpaper Underwear) to show the tool's humor/utility.

### Step 3: Reddit "Show HN" Style
*   **Goal:** Developer Adoption & Feedback.
*   **Draft:** "I built a CLI to roast my own business ideas. It uses Gemini 2.0 + Google Trends. Open Source."
*   **Focus:** Code quality, architecture (Hexagonal/Scouts), and "Roast me" attitude.

### Step 4: Facebook Groups
*   **Goal:** Non-technical user acquisition (The .exe users).
*   **Draft:** "I made a free tool to check if your business idea has customers before you spend a dime. No coding needed."

## 4. 🧪 Testing Strategy
*   **Review:** Verify tone matches "The Architect" (Cynical but Helpful).
*   **Links:** Ensure all drafts point to the correct GitHub URL.

## 5. ✅ Success Criteria
1.  Three distinct LinkedIn posts ready to schedule.
2.  One high-quality Reddit technical post.
3.  One accessible Facebook group post.
