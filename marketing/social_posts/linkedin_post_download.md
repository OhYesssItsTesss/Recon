# LinkedIn Post 1: The "Download" CTA

**Headline:** Stop building ghosts. Validate your startup idea in 30 seconds.

**Body:**
I have a hard drive full of "Next Big Things" that launched to absolute silence.
We all do.

The problem isn't building. The problem is building the *wrong thing*.

So I built a tool to fix my own bad habits.
Meet **Recon**.

It’s an open-source CLI that:
1.  Scans Google Trends for momentum.
2.  Scrapes Reddit for "visceral pain" (complaints).
3.  Uses AI to give you a brutal "Go/No-Go" score.

It doesn't hype you up. It tries to talk you out of it.
And if it can't... then you know you have a winner.

I'm releasing it for free today.
Run it on your idea. If it survives, build it.
