# LinkedIn Post 3: The "Hire Me" CTA

**Headline:** Most automations fail because they automate the wrong process.

**Body:**
I see this constantly. Companies spend $50k automating a workflow that generates $0 in value.
Efficiency is useless if you're efficient at the wrong thing.

That's why I start every engineering project with **Recon**.

Before I build a single automation for a client, I run my proprietary intelligence engine to validate the assumption.
- Is the demand real?
- Is the pain point visceral?
- Is the solution actually viable?

I don't just build code. I build *validated systems*.

If you're tired of "Tech Bros" building expensive toys that don't move the needle, let's have a conversation.
I'll run a Recon scan on your business process for free.
