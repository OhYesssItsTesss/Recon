# LinkedIn Post: The "Wake Up Call"

**Headline:** I built a tool that roasts my bad business ideas so I don't have to build them.

**Body:**

I have a hard drive full of half-finished projects. "The next big thing" that... wasn't.

We've all been there. You get an idea at 2 AM. You buy the domain. You spend 3 weeks coding the backend. And then you launch to... silence.

I got tired of the silence. I realized I was building "Ghosts"—products for people who didn't exist.

So I built **Recon**.

It's a CLI tool that acts as a cynical Chief Marketing Officer.
1. It scans **Google Trends** to see if anyone cares.
2. It scrapes **Reddit & Hacker News** to find people complaining (the visceral pain).
3. It uses **AI (Gemini 2.0)** to synthesize a brutal "Go/No-Go" verdict.

I tested it on my own passion project ("Leftover Labs") vs. a terrible idea ("Sandpaper Underwear"). The results were... humbling. And accurate.

It’s open source. It’s free. It runs on your machine.

Stop building ghosts. Validate your idea in 30 seconds.
