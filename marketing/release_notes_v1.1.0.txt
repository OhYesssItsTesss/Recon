Release title: Recon v1.1.0 - The "Deep Intel" Update

--- RELEASE NOTES ---

## 🧠 Smarter, Deeper, and More Transparent.
This update brings a massive upgrade to the intelligence engine, making Recon not just a validator, but a researcher that "shows its work."

### ✨ New Features in v1.1.0
- **Evidence-Based Insights:** The report now includes a "Why this Score?" section, citing specific quotes and insights from the sources it found.
- **Source Transparency:** Direct links to every Reddit thread, Hacker News discussion, or News article analyzed.
- **Resilient Scouting:** Added a **DuckDuckGo News Fallback**. If Reddit blocks the scan (403), Recon automatically pivots to news articles to ensure you always get data.
- **Smart "Nonsense" Detection:** The Strategist can now distinguish between "Unknown Niche" (Score 50) and "Terrible Idea" (Score 0-10) even with sparse data.
- **Web App Enhancements:** The Vercel deployment now includes "Remember Me" for emails and a fully responsive Sources UI.
- **Modern AI SDK:** upgraded to `google-genai` v1.0+ for future-proof stability.
